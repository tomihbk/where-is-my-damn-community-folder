# MSFS Community folder finder
This simply tries to find your MSFS community folder

## Running the project
Simply open "Community Folder Finder.csproj" and build the app

## VirusTotal
Due to the app not being signed and by using the plugin Fody, the algorithms of VirusTotal think it has a virus. But this is a false positive. If you don't believe me, check the code by yourself ;)
